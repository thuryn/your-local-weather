    <string name="help_page_general_content" tools:ignore="MissingTranslation">The app determines location using cellular network (BTS), Wi-Fi, and if those fail; GPS to show local weather, in turn getting the coordinates from the Mozilla location service. The application needs at least: one base station of GSM network or two reachable wifi networks or any combination of GSM and WIFI networks. Using the widget on your phone or tablet, you can see your location and current weather on the main screen. Location updates can be periodic, (ex. hourly) or the app can use the accelerometer to detect movement of greater distance than a value. Carried in your pocket, the distance increases faster. You can switch location updates off - only weather is then updated. The app updates location and weather in specified intervals. You can for example set update period to one hour o\'clock. The weather is updated immediately after location is, or when the screen is turned on - but not more often then once per 15 minutes (and when weather is not updated in the last 15 minutes). These information are used to get location coordinates by Mozilla location service. The app tries to use GPS when location is not available from cell network and Wi-Fi networks. Location coordinates are used to get address by Nominatim service. The address is used in the app or widget. The app uses OpenWeatherMap.org service to get current weather.</string>

    <string name="help_page_1_content_1_2" tools:ignore="MissingTranslation">Next to the update location button, there is a location management button (magnifier icon). You can manage locations available in the app and widgets. There is one location (Location 0) available by default - this is intended for automatic location updates. You can find enable/disable button when you slide this location leftwards. You can also add location manually. When you click on the + button you can pick up your location on map. You can also delete the location with the Delete button - which is accessible when you slide location leftwards.</string>
    <string name="help_page_1_content_2" tools:ignore="MissingTranslation">You can find weather forecast on the next screen (select the next screen in menu or swipe left to right).

When the limit for distance is reached and the last update occurs at least 15 minutes ago update of location and current weather is performed.
